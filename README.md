Updates : https://www.softpedia.com/get/PORTABLE-SOFTWARE/Programming/INZ-APKTool.shtml

Requirements :
Windows 7 or above
Java SE/JDK

NB :
As known, there are different types of apktool.jar errors.
if Error(s) occur(s) while decompiling or mostly while compiling,
please, try first to switch to earlier version (in some case 2.3.4 works better)
if error(s) still occurring, then check the log output (keywords) and do some research .
Also look at apktool's github issues
https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/issues

by default, Manifest , *.smali and resource files(*.xml strings , .. ) are edited with Notepad++
if Notepad++ is not available in your programs folder, a portable npp will be used instead
(it will temporarily be extracted to "Application data\local\temp\npp")
This later will be deleted after application close.

SAME as APKTool , APK EasyTool ..
INZ APKTool by Tidikelt GSM, is neither intended for piracy and other illegal uses
It could be used for localizing, adding some features or support for custom platforms,
analyzing applications ..etc.
